- Progress Indicator & Navigation: Visually represent the form's progress with a progress bar and clear navigation between steps.
- Budget Range Slider: Implement a range slider for the budget question, allowing users to select a value between 0 and 500,000 AED.
- Data Capture & Storage: Capture all user inputs and store them locally using Next.js state management or a similar mechanism, allowing for easy access and review.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a clean and professional color palette with a focus on neutral tones (e.g., light grays, whites) to create a sense of trust and reliability.
- Incorporate a primary color inspired by the provided link, such as a muted teal or seafoam green, to evoke feelings of growth and stability.
- Accent color: Use a vibrant coral or peach (#FF7F50 or #FFDAB9) sparingly for interactive elements and calls to action to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Maintain clear and readable typography for form labels and questions. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for accessibility.
- Employ a card-based layout, similar to the Coursiv example, to present each question or section in a visually distinct and organized manner.
- Subtle transitions and animations can be used to enhance the user experience when navigating between form steps. For example, a gentle slide or fade-in effect.
- Use simple and recognizable icons to represent different form options and support categories. Ensure the icons are consistent in style and weight.
